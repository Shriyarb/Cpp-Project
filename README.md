The Movie Ticket Booking System is a C++-based application designed to make reserving movie tickets easier and more efficient. This project allows users to check the availability of movies, select theaters, choose showtimes, and book seats in either Platinum or Gold classes. It features real-time seat availability checks to prevent double bookings and calculates ticket costs based on the number of seats selected. The application uses a menu-driven command-line interface and applies Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure a modular and efficient structure. The report details the design, implementation, and functionality of the system, highlighting its ability to handle various scenarios, such as invalid inputs and conflicting bookings, through effective error-handling mechanisms.
